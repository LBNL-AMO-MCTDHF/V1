./Relax.Bat

   then

./Pulse.Bat
./gnu.abs

    or

./Pulse.Perp.Bat
./gnu.abs.perp

You can execute the gnu scripts while the Pulse step is running, as long as 
it has reached T=100 atomic units.  It goes until 2000 atomic units (40fs).


this example seems like it could work better..  the result in ZDipoleft.Dat does not
look like it is converging uniformly...  use gnu.abs.here...  hmmmmmmm
