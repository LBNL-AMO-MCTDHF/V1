Now (v1.16 12-2015) the main code is OPEN SOURCE and the EXAMPLES-DEPOT
directory is private, available to users only, at repo

   https://github.com/LBNL-AMO-MCTDHF/EXAMPLES-DEPOT

You can git pull the private EXAMPLES-DEPOT repo into the empty 
V1/EXAMPLES-DEPOT subdirectory, to restore the original directory
structure.
