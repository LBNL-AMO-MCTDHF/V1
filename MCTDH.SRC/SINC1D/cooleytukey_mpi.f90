!!$   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
!!$
!!$   1. Definitions.
!!$
!!$      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
!!$      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
!!$
!!$      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
!!$      the copyright owner that is granting the License.
!!$
!!$      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
!!$      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
!!$      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
!!$      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
!!$      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
!!$      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
!!$      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
!!$
!!$      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
!!$      exercising permissions granted by this License.
!!$
!!$      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
!!$      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
!!$      source, and configuration files.
!!$
!!$      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
!!$      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
!!$      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
!!$      and conversions to other media types.
!!$
!!$      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
!!$      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
!!$      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
!!$      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
!!$
!!$      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
!!$      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
!!$      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
!!$      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
!!$      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
!!$      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
!!$      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
!!$
!!$      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
!!$      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
!!$      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
!!$      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
!!$      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
!!$      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
!!$      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
!!$      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
!!$      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
!!$      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
!!$      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
!!$      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
!!$      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
!!$
!!$      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
!!$      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
!!$      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
!!$
!!$   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
!!$      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
!!$      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
!!$      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
!!$      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
!!$      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
!!$
!!$   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
!!$      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
!!$      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
!!$      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
!!$      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
!!$      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
!!$      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
!!$      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
!!$      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
!!$      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
!!$      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
!!$      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
!!$      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
!!$      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
!!$      as of the date such litigation is filed.
!!$
!!$   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
!!$      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
!!$      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
!!$      meet the following conditions:
!!$
!!$      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
!!$          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
!!$
!!$      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
!!$          stating that You changed the files; and
!!$
!!$      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
!!$          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
!!$          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
!!$          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
!!$          the Derivative Works; and
!!$
!!$      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
!!$          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
!!$          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
!!$          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
!!$          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
!!$          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
!!$          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
!!$          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
!!$          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
!!$          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
!!$          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
!!$          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
!!$          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
!!$          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
!!$          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
!!$          as modifying the License.
!!$
!!$      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
!!$      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
!!$      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
!!$      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
!!$      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
!!$      the conditions stated in this License.
!!$
!!$   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
!!$      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
!!$      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
!!$      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
!!$      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
!!$      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
!!$      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
!!$
!!$   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
!!$      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
!!$      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
!!$      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
!!$
!!$   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
!!$      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
!!$      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
!!$      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
!!$      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
!!$      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
!!$      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
!!$      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
!!$      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
!!$
!!$   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
!!$      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
!!$      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
!!$      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
!!$      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
!!$      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
!!$      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
!!$      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
!!$      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
!!$      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
!!$      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
!!$
!!$   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
!!$      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
!!$      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
!!$      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
!!$      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
!!$      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
!!$      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
!!$      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
!!$      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
!!$      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
