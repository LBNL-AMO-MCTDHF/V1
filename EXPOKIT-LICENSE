!!$   
!!$   Page 137 (bottom) and Page 138 (top) should read:
!!$   The original large problem (5)   [instead of (10)]
!!$   has been converted to the small problem (6)   [instead of (11)]
!!$   
!!$   Page 142 (line 7) should read
!!$   An upper bound on (12)  [instead of (18)]
!!$   
!!$   Page 143 (line 6) should read
!!$   the upper bound in (13)  [instead of (19)]
!!$   
!!$   Page 143 (line 11) should read
!!$   it is reduced by formula (10)  [instead of (16)]
